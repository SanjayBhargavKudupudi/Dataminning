Summary of areas that need clarification:

1. The specific programming language to be used for creating the game.
2. The rules of the game - whether it's the standard rules or if there are any variations.
3. The structure of the game - is it a single player game against the computer, or a two-player game?
4. The level of complexity of the unit tests - what aspects of the game should they cover?
5. The platform for the game - is it a console application, a web application, or something else?

Clarifying question: What programming language should be used to create the Rock paper scissors game?
(answer in text, or "c" to move on)
c

(letting gpt-engineer make its own assumptions)

Assumptions:

1. The game will be created using Python, as it's a commonly used language for such tasks.
2. The game will follow the standard rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
3. The game will be a single-player game against the computer.
4. The unit tests will cover the basic functionality of the game, such as the game logic (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock) and the game outcome (win, lose, draw).
5. The game will be a console application, as it's the simplest platform to implement for this kind of game.

Clarifying question: Are these assumptions correct, or are there any adjustments you'd like to make?
Based on the assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game` class: This will be the main class that controls the game flow. It will have methods to start the game, get the player's choice, get the computer's choice, determine the winner, and display the result.

2. `Player` class: This will represent the player. It will have methods to get the player's choice.

3. `Computer` class: This will represent the computer. It will have methods to get the computer's choice.

4. `test_game.py`: This will contain the unit tests for the game. It will test the game logic and the game outcome.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

game.py
```python
import random

class Player:
    def get_choice(self):
        choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
        return choice

class Computer:
    def get_choice(self):
        choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
        return random.choice(choices)

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.computer = Computer()

    def start(self):
        player_choice = self.player.get_choice()
        computer_choice = self.computer.get_choice()

        print(f"You chose {player_choice}, computer chose {computer_choice}.")

        if player_choice == computer_choice:
            print("It's a draw!")
        elif (player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
             (player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper") or \
             (player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock"):
            print("You win!")
        else:
            print("You lose!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.start()
```

test_game.py
```python
import pytest
from game import Game, Player, Computer

def test_game_logic():
    game = Game()

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "scissors"
    assert game.start() == "You win!"

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "paper"
    assert game.start() == "You lose!"

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    assert game.start() == "It's a draw!"

def test_game_outcome():
    game = Game()

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "scissors"
    assert game.start() == "You win!"

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "paper"
    assert game.start() == "You lose!"

    game.player.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    game.computer.get_choice = lambda: "rock"
    assert game.start() == "It's a draw!"

Based on the assumptions, we will need the following classes and functions:

1. `Game` class: This will be the main class that controls the game flow. It will have methods to start the game, get the player's choice, get the computer's choice, determine the winner, and display the result.

2. `Player` class: This will represent the player. It will have methods to get the player's choice.

3. `Computer` class: This will represent the computer. It will have methods to get the computer's choice.

4. `test_game.py`: This will contain the unit tests for the game. It will test the game logic and the game outcome.

Now, let's write the code for each file.

game.py
